# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial expression classification using salient pattern driven integrated geometric and textual features
1. Using CK+ face dataset
2. Extract salient patterns of geometric and textual features
3. Based on the above features, using one vs rest SVM and other traditional machine learning algorithms in traditional_modeling.py
4. Also apply on deep learning frameworks like CNN
5. The accuracy of SVM has reached 86.58% for 7 emotions classification and more than 96% for 6 emotions classification (except contempt)
